		<h3>Learning Moments</h3>
		<h4>1. Some residents prefer alone time</h4>
		<p>At first, I thought a majority of my residents would be open and excited to interact and parcipate in programs. I knew some would rather keep to themselves or need some encouragement to join the group. However, I was no prepared for only getting parcipation from one to two residents regularly. Over time, I found out that some of my residents just did not know about the programs because they did not walk around the areas I hung posters or they did not read their messages. Others had been aware, they were just busy or not motivated at the time to join. As I have continued as an RA, I have become more aware of telltale signs of residents wanting alone time versus needing a little encouragement.</p>
		<h4>2. Team work isn't always dream-work</h4>
		<p>Just as residents may need a push to get out of their comfort zone, so do other teammates when working as a group. As I have worked on the PR Committee in East Village and we as a staff have worked to organized building wides. In these events, I felt my strengths in taking on administative roles as well as encouragment and check ins. The events were always on my mind so I constantly thinking of new ways to improve our reach and the event itself. </p>
		<h4>3. Housing is doing everything they can to develop Norse Life Community </h4>
		<p>As we introduced the mobile version of the Norse Life Community on Plunk, I have seen a growth of interest over residential life. Even in this tough time in Housing, with the closing of part of Woodcrest and dealing with teh virus, I have always appreciated our staffs positivity. With the residents always in mind, I feel Housing does its best to deal with each situation thrown their way. NKU is a community and it is the residents and leaders within it that makes it the proud and caring body of people that is the Norse Life Community.</p>
		
		<h3>Areas to Improve</h3>
		<h4>1. Interacting with Residents</h4>
		<p>I always envied how Becca's Honors residents would engage with her so often and be so excited to spend time with her. This semester I tried being more valunerable by opening my door and having games for my residents to play. From my end, I ended seeing people pass and say hi. Going forward I would like to keep this as well as improve by knocking on residents door weekly to get them to play a game or two.</p>
		<h4>2. Planning Programs</h4>
		<p>Last semester I issued a poll online to ask residents what types of programs they would like to see. I would like to do this again as well as plan them ahead so I can promote them longer and in different ways.</p>
		<h4>3. Encouraging Co-workers</h4>
		<p>Snaps at the end of meeting is always meaningful but I think engaging one on one with co-workers shows how important someone is to a team. I also like to send letters or small gifts to show my graditude. Next semester, I want to develop team morale by doing little gifts of thankfulness to my co-workers.</p>
