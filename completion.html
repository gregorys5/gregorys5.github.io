		<h3>"NKU will align the institution so more learners—particularly first-generation, post-traditional, low-income, and underrepresented individuals—earn highly-valued degrees, certificates and credentials.""</h3>
	
		<h4>• Enhance the culture of service-orientation that respects the realities of our students’ lives and provides consistent, responsive care and support across all areas with special emphasis on wellness, advising, financial aid, and career preparation.<br>
• Increase flexible, experiential and modular learning pathways that allow students to earn credentials along the way to their degree, and implement components of competency-based education in majors where possible.<br>
• Implement innovative instructional and curricular approaches to reduce time-to-degree.<br>
• Significantly improve retention, persistence and graduation rates with special emphasis on closing the achievement gap through meaningful use of predictive analytics and technology-based student success tools.<br>
• Align the institution’s policies, procedures, resources, rewards and incentives to encourage scholarship, creativity, collaboration, and innovations that advance student success.</h4>
<p>Going back to diversity, ensuring first-generation, post-traditional, low-income, and underrepresented individuals can graduate in a reasonable amount of time creates a diversity and open Norse Life Community. RAs can progress this through intentional programming (there is something for everyone), engagement, and doing our duty to keep everyone safe. We must have collegiality in our workplace as well as with residents, getting them help when they need it. We must make ourselves available to the community and if we cannot, we give them a direction to go. Focus on being an equitable Norse Life Community.</p>
